Standalone Notes:

+ python3 is required
+ pip3 install psutil
+ modify app<TEMPLATE>.sh by updating the path and rename it to app.sh (& chmod +x ./app.sh)
+ start foreground: app.sh nodaemon
+ start daemon: app.sh start
+ stop daemon: app.sh stop
+ status daemon: app.sh status


Docker Notes:

+ need to install and setup docker on your RPI (not part of this readme)
+ docker_udp_logger_rpi3 is your docker config file
+ the container directory needs to have appropriate permissions (chmod 777 ./container)
+ to build: docker build -t udp_logger_docker -f ./docker_udp_logger_rpi3 .
+ to run: docker run -v $PWD/container:/root/container udp_logger_docker

-> check for log file in container directory

Android Notes:

+ add the file 'UdpLogger.java' from the Android directory to your mobile app project
+ if needed adjust the package in this file
+ your app needs internet permission
+ from your app: call init() (e.g. in onCreate() of the MainActivity) This generates an unique ID and a AESKey.
  Init returns the AES Key (String) and writes it to the log (see logcat)
+ You only need to call init once, config is made persistent in the shared prefs of the app. So you can remove init()
  after initial use. To obtain the AES Key later again - just call init again
+ Also on app start (onCreate) call configure('YOUR_APP_NAME', 'ENCRYPT:TRUE/FALSE', 'REMOTE LOG HOST', 'REMOTE LOG PORT')
+ call log('SEVERITY OF YOUR CHOICE', 'MESSAGE')
